This folder contains all the necessary scripts to run a WESTPA calculation using GROMACS MD package.

We have modeled all the molecules using MARTINI forcefield. 
The run_westpa folder contains the necessary scripts to run the calculations, while analysis_westpa contains the python scripts
to estimate the different molecular properties I have described in this paper:
